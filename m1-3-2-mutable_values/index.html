  <h1>Mutable Values</h1>

    /*
    PROBLEM 1: Create a variable named str and set it equal to the string "hello"
               Next use bracket notation to try to mutate the string like this:
                str[0] = 'H';
               Now console log the variable str to see if it has changed
               Did the variable change? Why do you think that is?
    */
    let str = 'hello';
    // console.log(str)
    str[0] = `H`;
    // console.log(str)
    // - No, the string did not change... because it is immutable.

    // However, if we change the string to an object instead:

    const strObject = {
      str: function() {
        return `Hello`
      }
    };
    // console.log(strObject.str())

    // ... we are able to take the initial value of said immutable variable and create a new variable stored separately from the original.





    /*
    PROBLEM 2: Create a variable named num and set it equal to the number 5
               Next use += to add three to the num variable like this:
                num += 3;
               Now console log the variable num to see if it has changed
               Did the variable change? Why?
    */
    let num = 5;
    num += 3;
    // console.log(num)

    // No, it may appear that way, but we merely reassigned the variable "num" to a different number entirely with the "+=" operator.





     /*
    PROBLEM 3: Here is an object named obj containing a car called a "Honda" and owned by someone named "John".
               On the second line, use the right side of the equal sign to change the owner's name to "Tony"
               Now console log obj to see if it has changed.
               Did the object change? Why?
    */
    let obj = { owner: "John", car: "Honda" };
    obj.owner = `Tony`;
    // console.log(obj.owner)

    // Yes, the value changed from one to another because the object containing the value allowed us to reassign, the value to another entirely. The value itself did not change!





    /*
    PROBLEM 4: Here is an array named arr containing an array of numbers.
               On the second line, inside the parentheses, add the number 4.
               Now console log arr to see if it has changed
               Did the array change? Why?
    */
    let arr = [1, 2, 3];
    arr.push(4);
    // console.log(arr);

    // Yes, we changed the array. Because arrays are "mutable" values, we were able to change its over-all value.





    /*
    PROBLEM 5 (DEBUGGING): In the following snippet, we want to change the punctuation at the end of the string.
              We're trying to directly modify the string, but like in our first problem, it's not working.
              Fix the code so that the string is changed to "Welcome to Bloomtech!"
