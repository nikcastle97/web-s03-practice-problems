    PROBLEM 1: Declare an array called originalFruits with the values ['apple', ['orange', 'lemon']].
    Use the spread operator to make a shallow copy of the array into a variable called copyFruits.
    Then, change the value of the second element of the copy array to ['pineapple'].

    PROBLEM 2: Declare an object called originalNums with the properties { a: { b: 2 } }.
    Use the spread operator to make a shallow copy of the object into a variable called copyNums.
    Then, change the value of the b property in the copy object to 3.
