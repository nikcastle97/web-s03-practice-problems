  <h1>Arrow Functions and the This Keyword SOLUTION</h1>

    PROBLEM 1: Change the arrow function on the multiply method to the correct syntax used within an object. Console.log the object before and after the change to see the results printed to the console.

      multiply: (a, b) => a * b * this.multiplier;

    };

    /*
    PROBLEM 2: Change the arrow function called calculateTotal to work within the flock object below while also using the 'this' keyword. Console.log the calculateTotal method to see the results printed to the console.

    let sum = 0;
    const calculateTotal = (number) => sum += number;

    /*
   PROBLEM 3: Change the arrow function called countdown to work within the game object below while using the 'this' keyword. Console.log the method to see the results printed to the console.
