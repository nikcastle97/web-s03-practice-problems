       • A boolean showing if the knife is sharp or not
       • The size of the knife
       • A cut method with a number and a food item as parameters that returns "cut (add food) in (add number) seconds"

        • A type property with a value of Italian

    /*
    PROBLEM 5 (DEBUGGING): When trying to have a hostess seat a table, you are getting this error: "Unexpected token 'function'". Fix this error and console.log the seat method so that the method prints to the console. Note: You can solve this with either method syntax.

    let hostess = {
      name: "Cara",
      experience: "7 years",
      function seat(number){
        return `Right this way to table ${number}`;

    let hostess = {
      name: "Cara",
      experience: "7 years",
      seat: function (number) { // fixed the syntax by making "seat" the key
        return `Right this way to table ${number}`;
      }
    }

    console.log(hostess.seat(5));

    //OTHER SYNTAX ANSWER
    // let hostess = {
    //     name: "Cara",
    //     experience: "7 years",
    //     seat(number) {
    //       return `Right this way to table ${number}`;
    //     }
