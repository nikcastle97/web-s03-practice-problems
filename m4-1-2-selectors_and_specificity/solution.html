  This practice will revisit some simple CSS styling, while reinforcing the following cascade rule: specificity.

<html>

<head>
  <style>
    div {
      border: 3px solid black;
      padding: 10px;
      font-size: 24px;
    }

    /* PROBLEM 1
      With only one declaration, change the color of paragraphs 2 and 3 to blue, without changing the color of the paragraph 1.
      */
    /* ANSWER: If you style p all paragraphs will be targeted. We need to be specific */
    div p {
      color: blue;
    }

    /* PROBLEM 2
      Now, add code to change the background color of paragraph 3 to yellow.
      */
    /* ANSWER: We must be even more specific now, because it's only one paragraph inside the div to be targeted. If you look at the HTML code, there's already a class assign to this paragraph. */
    .warning {
      background-color: yellow;
    }

    /* PROBLEM 3
      Add code to change the 'text inside div'. and only it, to 36px.
      */
    /* ANSWER: This text inside div has no other tag, class or id. So first we need to target 'div', and then add font-size to 'div p' to override it. */
    div {
      font-size: 36px;
    }

    div p {
      font-size: 24px;
    }

    /* PROBLEM 4
      Use the least specific selector to change the first paragraph to red.
      */
    /* ANSWER: 'div p' already has a color set to it and is more specific than 'p'. So we can target 'p' */
    p {
      color: red;
    }

    /* PROBLEM 5 (DEBUGGING)
      Somehow we are unable to change the color of the span to green. Why? What can you do to fix that?
      */
    /* ANSWER: There's an inline style in the HTML. Since we don't want to edit the HTML, the only solution is to add !important. */
    span {
      color: green !important;
    }
  </style>
</head>

<body>
  <h1>TITLE</h1>
  <span style="color: black">Span inside body</span>
  <p>Paragraph 1 inside body</p>
  <div>
    Text inside div
    <p>Paragraph 2 inside div</p>
    <p class="warning">Warning in paragraph 3 inside div</p>
  </div>
