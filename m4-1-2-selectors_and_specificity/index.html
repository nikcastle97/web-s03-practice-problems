<html>

<head>
  <style>
    div {
      border: 3px solid black;
      padding: 10px;
      font-size: 24px;
    }

    /* PROBLEM 1
      With only one declaration, change the color of paragraphs 2 and 3 to blue, without changing the color of the paragraph 1.
      */
    /* ENTER YOUR CODE HERE */

    /* PROBLEM 2
      Now, add code to change the background color of paragraph 3 to yellow.
      */
    /* ENTER YOUR CODE HERE */

    /* PROBLEM 3
      Add code to change the 'text inside div'. and only it, to 36px.
      */
    /* ENTER YOUR CODE HERE */

    /* PROBLEM 4
      Use the least specific selector to change the first paragraph to red.
      */
    /* ENTER YOUR CODE HERE */

    /* PROBLEM 5 (DEBUGGING)
      Somehow we are unable to change the color of the span to green. Why? What can you do to fix that?
      */
    span {
      color: green;
    }
  </style>
</head>

  <h1>TITLE</h1>
  <span style="color: black">Span inside body</span>
  <p>Paragraph 1 inside body</p>
  <div>
    Text inside div
    <p>Paragraph 2 inside div</p>
    <p class="warning">Warning in paragraph 3 inside div</p>
